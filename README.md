## Tool intro

Hi, this is a new-year-themed particle interaction tool with hand gesture.

Here when you show the emoji "six", you'll see 'Bye 2025' on the screen.

Then when you use hand gesture for countdown (5 to 1), you'll see the how the number changes.

After you use fist, you'll see firework sparkles around and a gradual transition of 'Happy 2026' appearing on the screen.

You can customize your choice about particle size, density, fluidity, and color themes; or you can choose to turn on the camera by changing the default background to your own.

Happy new year and have fun with your family and friends!
